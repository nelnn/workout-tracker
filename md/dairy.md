- I am focusing on building my bench press strength by following the [Smolov Jr. Program](https://www.smolovjr.com/smolov-squat-program/). 
- Working on my hip and ankle mobility for ATG squat. I have terrible mobility in these area and I have never been able to be in an ATG position without lifting my heels off the ground since I was little. But I would like to give it a chance to find out if I can achieve it by stretching and sitting in that position by holding on to a counter weight.
- Recently injuried my lower back (again!) doing hyperextension followed by L sit. It first got injuuired a couple months ago when I was doing deadlift (110 kg) and since then the pain has persisted. My hip and back also didn't feel comfortable after squating ATG. So at the moment I have stopped training for squats and deadlift and focusing on my flexibility.
