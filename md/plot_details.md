**Resistance Band**: I have 4 bands of different thickness. From thinnest to thickest: purple, black, green, orange. I assign [purple: 0.8kg, black: 0.6kg, green: 0.2kg, orange: 0.1kg] in order to plot them on the charts.

**Body Weight**: If no weight is added to the exercise we set the weight to $1$ in order to plot the total volume."

**Count**: The 'Count' variable specifies the number of reps or the number of seconds performed for the exercise.
